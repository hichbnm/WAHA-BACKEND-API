I've made several key updates to implement the requirements:

Session Management and Monitoring:

Added SessionMonitor service that checks for inactive sessions every hour
Sessions inactive for 12+ days are pinged to keep them alive
If a session becomes disconnected, it's marked for re-authentication
QR code authentication is handled by the existing sessions router
Campaign Management:

Added complete campaign CRUD operations
Campaign status tracking with detailed message status
Support for filtering campaigns by sender, date range, and status
Rate limiting and queueing built into the MessageQueue service
Security Model:

Clear separation between user-level and admin endpoints
User endpoints identify by sender_number
Admin endpoints require API key authentication
WAHA API key properly included in all requests
API Endpoints:

POST /api/send - Create new campaign
GET /api/status/:campaign_id - Get campaign status
GET /api/status/:campaign_id?details=true - Get detailed message status
GET /api/campaigns - List campaigns with filters
GET /api/session/:sender_number/status - Check session status
DELETE /api/session/:sender_number - Remove session
GET /api/metrics - System-wide metrics (admin)
GET /api/users - List all users (admin)
Metrics and Monitoring:

Active sessions count
Messages sent today
Queue size
Server uptime
Campaign statistics
Per-user statistics
Error Handling:

Proper error handling for WAHA API requests
Database transaction management
Detailed logging
Clear error messages for common issues
Session and Connection Management:

Auto-monitoring of session activity
QR code-based authentication
Session keep-alive for active users
Clear re-authentication prompts when needed
The system now supports all the required features for the Chrome extension to:

Send bulk messages through the API
Monitor sending progress
Get detailed delivery reports
Handle WhatsApp authentication via QR codes
Maintain persistent sessions
Let me know if you'd like me to focus on any specific aspect or make any improvements!
